System Architecture
WorldClass Crypto Exchange follows a modular architecture with several key components:

Trading Engine: The heart of the exchange, responsible for order matching, execution, and market data generation. Implemented with a focus on low latency and high throughput.
Wallet System: Manages user funds with HD wallet architecture, multi-signature support, and cold storage integration.
Security Layer: Provides authentication, authorization, and behavioral biometrics for continuous user verification.
API Gateway: Exposes RESTful and WebSocket interfaces for clients to interact with the exchange.
Database Layer: Handles persistent storage with a focus on reliability and consistency.
Monitoring & Metrics: Tracks system performance and health across all components.
Technology Stack
Backend: Rust for performance-critical components
Database: PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for persistent data
Caching: Redis for high-performance data access
Deployment: Kubernetes for container orchestration
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and visualization
Frontend (upcoming): TypeScript and React
Required Programming Languages & Skills
Rust: Primary language for backend development (trading engine, API, database layer)
SQL: For database queries and schema management
JavaScript/TypeScript (upcoming): For frontend development
Docker/Kubernetes: For containerization and deployment
WebSocket Protocol: For real-time data streaming

Use efficient data structures (BTreeMap for order books)
Minimize memory allocations
Avoid locking where possible
Profile and benchmark regularly
Correctness:
Implement comprehensive test cases
Verify order matching logic
Ensure proper handling of edge cases
Maintain transaction atomicity
Reliability:
Implement circuit breakers
Handle error cases gracefully
Log all operations for audit
Design for recovery after failures
Database Implementation
For the database layer:

Data Models:
Design normalized schema
Use appropriate indices
Consider data access patterns
Implement proper constraints
Repository Pattern:
Create clean repository interfaces
Implement transaction management
Use connection pooling
Add retry mechanisms for resilience
Performance:
Use prepared statements
Optimize queries
Consider read/write splitting
Implement caching where appropriate
API Implementation
When developing the API gateway:

RESTful Design:
Follow REST principles
Use consistent response formats
Implement proper status codes
Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
WebSocket Implementation:
Design efficient message formats
Handle connection management
Implement proper authentication
Consider scaling challenges
Security:
Validate all inputs
Implement rate limiting
Use proper authentication and authorization
Protect against common attacks
