# WorldClass Crypto Exchange: Next Implementation Steps

This document outlines the next steps for implementing the WorldClass Crypto Exchange platform after adding the database and metrics modules.

## Current Status

You've successfully set up:
- Repository structure with all necessary directories
- Basic configuration and main application entry point
- Database connection layer with models and repositories
- Metrics collection and monitoring setup

## Next Priority Implementation Areas

### 1. Complete the Trading Engine Core

The trading engine is the heart of the exchange. Focus on implementing:


- **Risk Management Module** (src/trading_engine/risk_manager.rs)

#### Implementation Order:


3. Finally implement the Risk Manager that validates orders before they enter the matching engine

### 2. Implement the Security Component

Security is critical for a cryptocurrency exchange. Focus on:

- **Authentication Flow** (src/security/auth.rs)
- **JWT Token Management** (src/security/auth.rs)
- **Rate Limiting** (src/security/rate_limiter.rs)

### 3. Build Basic API Endpoints

With the core components in place, implement API endpoints:

- **Health Check Endpoint** (src/api/mod.rs)
- **User Registration and Login** (src/api/rest.rs)
- **Basic Trading Endpoints** (src/api/rest.rs)

### 4. Create Docker Compose for Local Development

Set up a complete development environment with:

- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- The exchange services

## Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Trading Engine Tasks

1. **Order Book Implementation**
   - Create a price-time priority order book
   - Implement efficient data structures for quick lookups
   - Add methods for adding, canceling, and matching orders

2. **Matching Engine Implementation**
   - Implement the order matching algorithm
   - Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations
   - Add support for different order types

3. **Risk Management**
   - Implement position limits
   - Add balance checks
   - Create price circuit breakers

### Security Tasks

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement password hashing and verification
   - Create JWT token generation and validation
   - Add multi-factor authentication support

2. **Permission Management**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Create permission checks for API endpoints

### API Tasks

1. **RESTful API Implementation**
   - Create user management endpoints
   - Implement trading endpoints
   - Add wallet management endpoints

2. **Middleware Implementation**
   - Create authentication middleware
   - Implement rate limiting middleware
   - Add request logging middleware

## Testing Strategy

For each implemented component:

1. Write unit tests to verify core functionality
2. Create integration tests to ensure components work together
3. Perform load testing for performance-critical components

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these components:

- Follow Rust best practices for error handling
- Use proper logging at appropriate levels
- Add metrics for performance-critical operations
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Write tests alongside implementation

## Suggested Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete the Order Book and Matching Engine
2. **Week 2**: Implement Security Components
3. **Week 3**: Create Basic API Endpoints
4. **Week 4**: Set Up Local Development Environment and Testing

## Next Steps for the Next Development Session

For your next development session, focus on:

1. Implement the Order Book in src/trading_engine/order_book.rs
2. Create the Matching Engine in src/trading_engine/matching_engine.rs
3. Add unit tests for both components

This focused approach will ensure you have a working core trading engine, which is the most critical component of the exchange.
