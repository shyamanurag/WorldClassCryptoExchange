Critical Implementation Guidelines
1. Trading Engine Implementation
The trading engine is the heart of the exchange. Consider these critical aspects:

Programming Languages and Requirements
Primary Language: Rust (version 1.70+)
Key Libraries:
tokio for async runtime
serde for serialization/deserialization
chrono for time handling
uuid for unique identifiers
log and env_logger for logging
Order Book Data Structure
Use memory-efficient data structures (BTreeMap for price levels)
Implement price-time priority ordering
Convert prices to integer representation to avoid floating-point issues
Maintain index structures for fast order lookups
rust
// Example order book price level structure
struct PriceLevel {
    price: u64,  // Price in minor units (e.g., satoshis)
    orders: VecDeque<Order>,  // Orders at this price level (FIFO)
    total_quantity: f64,  // Total quantity at this price level
}
Matching Engine
Implement efficient matching algorithms optimized for Rust
Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
Include circuit breakers for market protection
Implement detailed logging for all matching events
Risk Management
Pre-trade validation to prevent invalid orders
Account balance checks for sufficient funds
Position limits to prevent excessive exposure
Price bands to prevent erroneous trades
Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
2. Database Layer Implementation
Programming Languages and Requirements
Primary Language: Rust (version 1.70+)
Database: PostgreSQL 15+
Key Libraries:
tokio-postgres for PostgreSQL interaction
deadpool-postgres for connection pooling
async-trait for async repository patterns
refinery for migrations (optional)
For the database layer, consider:

Use connection pooling for efficient database access
Implement repository pattern for clean separation of concerns
Use prepared statements for all database operations
Implement transaction management for data consistency
Include retry mechanisms for database operations
rust
// Example repository pattern
trait OrderRepository {
    async fn save(&self, order: Order) -> Result<(), DbError>;
    async fn find_by_id(&self, id: &str) -> Result<Option<Order>, DbError>;
    async fn find_by_user(&self, user_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<Order>, DbError>;
    async fn update_status(&self, id: &str, status: OrderStatus) -> Result<(), DbError>;
}
3. API Gateway
Programming Languages and Requirements
Primary Language: Rust (version 1.70+)
Key Libraries:
warp for HTTP and WebSocket server
tokio for async runtime
serde_json for JSON processing
jsonwebtoken for JWT authentication
futures-util for async stream processing
The API gateway should:

Implement RESTful and WebSocket interfaces
Use proper authentication and authorization
Include rate limiting and request validation
Implement comprehensive error handling
Include detailed API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
